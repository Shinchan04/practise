To maintain the longevity of the product life; it is imperative that the processes are aligned with organic stature of the product.</p>
<p>SLCM has evolved this service for more than 40 varieties of dry food products such as grains, cereals and spices, condiment, etc. in four states in India & now in Myanmar as well.
